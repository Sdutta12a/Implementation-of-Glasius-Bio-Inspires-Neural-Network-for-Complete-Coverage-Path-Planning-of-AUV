I completed this project as my summer research internship at the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) at IIT Mandi, under the supervision of Dr. Jagadessh Kadiyam, Assistant Professor at CAIR, IIT Mandi.
Complete coverage path planning for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is achieved using the Glasius Bio-Inspired Neural Network (GBNN) algorithm. The process begins by discretizing the AUV's underwater workspace into a two-dimensional grid map. This grid map serves as the basis for constructing a corresponding neural network. Each grid cell corresponds to a neuron in the network.

The GBNN algorithm is then applied to update the neural network's activity based on the state of the grid map. This involves continuously adjusting the neural activities to reflect the presence of obstacles and the goal of achieving complete coverage. The neural network processes information about the environment, updating its state in real-time to account for any dynamic changes in the workspace.

Path planning is carried out by leveraging the updated neural network activity. The GBNN algorithm guides the AUV along a path that ensures complete coverage of the workspace, taking into account the need to minimize path length, reduce the number of turns, and avoid revisiting areas unnecessarily. This helps in conserving the AUV's energy, which is crucial for efficient operation.

Obstacle avoidance is seamlessly integrated into this path planning process. The neural network is designed to respond to obstacles in the grid map by altering the neural activities associated with the affected areas. This dynamic response ensures that the AUV can navigate around obstacles while still maintaining the goal of complete coverage.
